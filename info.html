	<p><i>
		Several nations of Taes Leth collaborated to create a security system around a newly-discovered
		portal that had landed itself in the middle of a ruined city. However, the Dwarven Council held
		their ground and refused to help fund the project and protect people from potential danger.
		Fortunately, one of the wealthier nobles of the Council, who oversaw many successful coal mines,
		stepped up and added their own funds to the cause, with more than enough to finish quickly.
		Bridulvik, the dwarven capital was located nearby the portal and Mena Veromin, a volunteering
		noble, took up many tasks related to the portal. Unfortunately, it has been said that many
		adventures that have found their way back from the portal return with riches beyond imaginable,
		but many more have been lost to the unknown, never to return.
